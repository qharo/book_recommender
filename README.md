# ðŸ“š Book Recommender

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d3ced06-ac5e-44a7-87d1-e2483d84cebe

Built with Streamlit and an embedding model, it allows users to find their next read by describing what they're looking for or by selecting books they've previously enjoyed. The system explains recommendations, displays book covers and summaries, and provides links to additional information. It's containerized with Docker and configured for deployment on Fly.io. The application uses semantic vector representations to find similar books and features an intuitive, responsive interface.
